* [Python model code: model.py](https://github.com/stephenvfg/behavioral-cloning/blob/master/model.py) containing the script to create and train the model
* [Autonomous driving code: drive.py](https://github.com/stephenvfg/behavioral-cloning/blob/master/drive.py) for driving the car in autonomous mode
* [Compiled Keras model: model.h5](https://github.com/stephenvfg/behavioral-cloning/blob/master/model.h5) containing a trained convolution neural network 
* [Writeup: writeup.md](https://github.com/stephenvfg/behavioral-cloning/blob/master/writeup.md) summarizing the results - this document!
* [Output video for track 1: video.mp4](https://github.com/stephenvfg/behavioral-cloning/blob/master/video.mp4) which shows the vehicle successfully driving on track 1.
* [Output video for track 2: challenge-video.mp4](https://github.com/stephenvfg/behavioral-cloning/blob/master/challenge-video.mp4) which shows the vehicle attempting and having difficulty driving on track 2.
