# Description

This repository contains the files for a project from the [Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013). The goal of this project was to create a machine learning model trained on simulated driving behavior data to power an autonomous vehicle driving on the same tracks.

**Project code:**

* [Python model code (model.py)](https://github.com/stephenvfg/behavioral-cloning/blob/master/model.py) containing the script to create and train the model
* [Autonomous driving code (drive.py)](https://github.com/stephenvfg/behavioral-cloning/blob/master/drive.py) for driving the car in autonomous mode
* [Compiled Keras model (model.h5)](https://github.com/stephenvfg/behavioral-cloning/blob/master/model.h5) containing a trained convolution neural network
